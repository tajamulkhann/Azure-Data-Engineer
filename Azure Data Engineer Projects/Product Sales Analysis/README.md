### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To develop a fully integrated and scalable Product Sales Analytics Dashboard using Microsoft Fabric. The project combines diverse data sources (Azure SQL DB, CSV, Excel), performs advanced transformations using Pipelines and Notebooks, and visualizes business-critical metrics such as market performance, product-wise sales, customer revenue, and sales trends â€” all in real-time using Power BI.

### ðŸ§± 1. Workspace & Architecture Setup
Step 1: Fabric Workspace Creation
Created a Fabric Capacity Workspace with all essential features:

Lakehouse

Warehouse

Pipelines

Notebooks

Dataflows Gen2

### ðŸ—‚ 2. Data Ingestion & Storage
Step 2: Lakehouse and Warehouse Setup
Lakehouse: Established as the core storage layer for all structured and semi-structured datasets.

Warehouse: Built for SQL-based modeling and BI access.

Step 3: Integrated Multi-Source Data
Azure SQL Database: Used Fabric Data Pipelines to ingest sales transaction data.

CSV Files: Imported market-level and product-level sales using the Load to Tables feature.

Excel Files: Ingested forecast and target data using Dataflows Gen2.

Notebook Transformation (PySpark)
One dataset required complex transformation logic (e.g., dynamic revenue adjustments or mapping region-customer hierarchies). Implemented:

Advanced joins and filtering

Grouping and window operations

Transformation chaining

Output saved into Lakehouse tables

### ðŸ§© 3. Data Modeling
Step 4: Modeled via SQL Endpoint
Accessed Lakehouse SQL Endpoint to build relationships and logic.

Designed a star schema:

Fact Table: SalesTransactions

Dimension Tables: Customer, Product, Region, Market, Calendar

Key Measures Created
sql
Copy
Edit
Total Revenue = SUM(SalesTransactions[Revenue])
Total Quantity = SUM(SalesTransactions[Qty])
Also implemented:

YoY Growth

Target Achievement %

### ðŸ“Š 4. Report Design in Power BI
